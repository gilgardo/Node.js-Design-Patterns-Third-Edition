The dimensional rift spread rapidly. The space around it crumbled, revealing emptiness behind it.

An Lan, Cao Hongtu, and all the others noticed the abnormality of the dimensional rift. Their expressions changed.

“Damn it, the Flaming River World is about to collapse,” Sinclamon exclaimed in shock. He realized what was happening.

“Collpase in advance!” Wang Teng stared at the scenes around him and felt that Sinclamon’s guess was right.

“If the Flaming River World collapses in advance, we won’t have a chance to get the legacy,” Cao Hongtu said in a low voice.

“The legacy!” Sinclamon’s expression turned somber. This was the reason why he came here.

He didn’t manage to snatch the divine flame. If he lost the legacy, he would have to go back empty-handed. It was exasperating.

Wang Teng continued staring at the dimensional rift. Suddenly, he squinted. There were attribute bubbles being born.

He regained his senses and happily picked them up.

Space*100

Space*120

Space Fragment*50

Space*90

Space*150

…

Huh? There’s a space fragment attribute!?Wang Teng was shocked.

Most of the bubbles contained space attributes, but there were a few that had space fragment attributes inside.

Wang Teng had a space fragment, but it wasn’t big. With the additional space fragment attributes, his space fragment increased in size.

Did the space fragment attribute appear because the Flaming River World is collapsing??Wang Teng wondered to himself.

Large amounts of space attributes were dropped with a few space fragment attributes hidden among them. Wang Teng was overjoyed.

He thought that the collapse of the Flaming River World wasn’t a good thing, but there were so many benefits to gain.

It was worth it!

Boom!

A sudden explosion came from the distance.

Everyone was staggered. They turned and looked in the direction of the sound.

A terrifying pillar of fire spurted out from the center of the Flaming River World. It soared straight into the sky, linking the earth and heaven.

Despite being far away, they could still see this magnificent scene. Everyone widened their eyes in awe and amazement.

“What’s going on?” An Lan asked the question on everyone’s mind.

“That’s where the volcano is. It’s where the last legacy is hidden,” Wang Teng whispered.

“Legacy!” An Lan frowned.

Cao Hongtu and Sinclamon thought of the same thing. They looked at each other.

“What should we do? This pillar of fire must be caused by the volcano in the center. The legacy is in the volcano. I suspect that there’s a relationship between them,” Cao Hongtu said.

Sinclamon’s expression kept changing. In the end, he gritted his teeth and said, “Let’s go and take a look.”

“What about them?”

“Ignore them. The two divine flames will belong to my family. They can’t run away,” Sinclamon glanced at Wang Teng coldly and said.

“Father, Sister is still in his hands.” Cao Wu interrupted them after some hesitation.

“Jiaojiao is still useful to him. He won’t kill her for now,” Cao Hongtu shook his head and said.

After conversing for some time, they rushed towards the pillar of fire.

…

“They’re going there,” An Lan said after seeing them fly away. “It looks like they still haven’t given up on the legacy.”

“Come, let’s go over too.” Wang Teng picked up the attribute bubbles and chased after them.

“I knew it.” An Lan shook his head. Then, he waved his hand and led the three mecha martial warriors over.

Before they left, they turned and glanced at the collapsing sky. The pillar of fire seemed near, but there was still some distance between them. Based on their speed, they would need half a day to rush over.

As the space around the flaming river started collapsing, the time became tighter. There might not be enough time for them.

Hence, Wang Teng and An Lan raised their speed to the maximum and charged toward the volcano without stopping.

Cao Hongtu and Sinclamon were some distance ahead of them. They didn’t fight with one another. Instead, they hurried on their journey. They didn’t want to waste time on fighting.

Half a day later, Cao Hongtu and Sinclamon, who were in front, stopped. They started observing the pillar of fire from afar.

Wang Teng and his team stopped too. The volcano range laid out in front of him, stretching into the distance. There was nothing else.

The pillar of fire was shooting out from the volcano right in the center.

That volcano was the highest so Wang Teng and his team saw it instantly. They wouldn’t be wrong.

“What does the eruption of the volcano have to do with the drying of the river?” Wang Teng asked curiously.

An Lan didn’t know the answer. “Do you want to go over?”

“No hurry. Let’s see what they plan to do,” Wang Teng replied.

“I know that you’re up to no good.”

“Hey, watch what you’re saying. How do you know what I’m planning to do?”

“If you were not, you’d have gone up already.” An Lan glanced at him from the corner of his eyes.

“You’re framing me. Don’t say anything if you don’t have evidence.” Wang Teng rolled his eyes.

An Lan chuckled.

After some time, Cao Hongtu and Sinclamon got impatient and flew ahead, landing on the volcano in the center.

“Huh? They’ve gone over. Let’s follow them,” Wang Teng said hurriedly.

Before An Lan could react, he dashed forward excitedly.

An Lan shook his head. Wasn’t it obvious that he wanted to trick Cao Hongtu and the others?

The instant Cao Hongtu and his team landed on the volcano, Wang Teng and his team also arrived. He noticed attribute bubbles floating beside the pillar of fire.

Attribute bubbles again!

Collect!

Constellation Force (Fire)*300

Constellation Force (Fire)*120

Constellation Force (Fire)*200

…

These attribute bubbles were all constellation fire Force. There was nothing special, so Wang Teng didn’t give them much attention. However, he still picked them up, every single one of them.

Sinclamon looked at them grimly. He felt helpless. Wang Teng was following them because he wanted them to lead the way. He knew that he was up to no good.

Wang Teng ignored them and started thinking.

The legacy was below the volcano, but this volcano had erupted. The pillar of fire shot right into the sky. No one knew how powerful the pillar of fire was. Could they get closer to it?

This pillar of fire was spurted out randomly. No one knew if it was dangerous.

This was what Wang Teng was frightened of.

Sinclamon glanced at them eerily. There was nothing he could do to them, so he ignored them and went to check out the pillar of fire.

A few seconds later, he leaped into the pillar of fire.

Cao Hongtu remained outside. He didn’t enter.

Wang Teng released his spiritual power and Emerald Glazed Flame. The Emerald Glazed Flame wrapped around his spiritual power as it moved towards the pillar of fire, sensing the situation inside.

He realized that there was no danger inside and Sinclamon wasn’t waiting to ambush him. He had already gone further down.

“Let me enter and take a look,” Wang Teng said.

“Do you need me to follow you?” An Lan asked with a frown.

Sinclamon had already entered. Wang Teng wasn’t his match. There might be danger if he entered alone.

Wang Teng contemplated for some time before shaking his head. “No need. I’ll enter alone.

“The Flaming River World is collapsing soon. I’ll take a look and come back quickly if there’s no hope.”

He paused for a moment before continuing, “As for Sinclamon, I have ways to stay alive even if I meet him. He won’t be able to catch me easily.”

An Lan nodded and kept quiet. Wang Teng was a person with his own plan. His ability and experience were all top-notch, and he was extremely sly. There was no need to worry about him.

Wang Teng walked towards the pillar. He glanced at Cao Hongtu and smiled. “Senior Brother Cao, pray that I’ll be safe or your daughter will have to play a bitter romance drama with me.”

“You!” Cao Hongtu’s expression turned ugly.

“Hahaha.” Wang Teng laughed heartily and jumped into the pillar of fire. He left a back view for Cao Hongtu to admire.
